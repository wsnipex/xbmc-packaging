Description: XBMC Media Center (arch-independent data package)
 XBMC, recursive acronym for "XBMC Media Center", is an award winning free and
 open source software media-player and entertainment hub for all your digital

 and developed by volunteers located around the world. More than 50 software
 developers have contributed to XBMC, and 100-plus translators have worked to

 HTPC. Supporting an almost endless range of remote controls, and combined
 with its beautiful interface and powerful skinning engine, XBMC feels very
 natural to use from the couch and is the ideal solution for your home
 theater. Once installed, your computer will become a fully functional
 multimedia jukebox.
